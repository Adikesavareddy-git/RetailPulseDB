RetailPulseDB

RetailPulseDB is a custom-designed SQL practice database that simulates real-world retail business operations.
It is built to practice intermediate to advanced SQL queries commonly asked in data analyst and SQL developer interviews.
This project focuses on business-driven analytics, not toy examples.

🎯 Project Objective
Most SQL portfolios fail because they:
Use recycled sample databases
Avoid real analytics logic
Don’t demonstrate business thinking
RetailPulseDB is built to:
Practice interview-level SQL
Demonstrate analytical problem-solving
Showcase clean schema design
Support LinkedIn & GitHub portfolio use

Database Overview
Database Name: RetailPulseDB
Database Type: Relational (Normalized)
Tables
Table	Description
Customers	Customer details and signup date
Products	Product catalog with category and pricing
Orders	Customer order transactions
OrderDetails	Line-level product quantities per order
Design Principles
Fully normalized schema
No stored revenue or totals
All metrics derived through queries
Foreign key relationships enforced

📐 Schema Structure
Customers → Orders → OrderDetails ← Products
This structure enables:
Customer lifetime value analysis
Revenue and order trend analysis
Product performance insights
Interview-style joins and aggregations

🧠 SQL Concepts Demonstrated
This project covers real interview expectations, including:
INNER & LEFT JOINs
GROUP BY & HAVING
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Window Functions (RANK, AVG)
Revenue & order analytics
Time-based analysis (monthly trends)
If you can explain these queries clearly, you are interview-ready.

📊 Sample Analytical Queries
The project includes queries such as:
Total revenue generated by each customer
Top-selling product in each category
Customers with multiple orders
Average order value per customer
Inactive customers (last 90 days)
Monthly revenue trend
Customer lifetime value ranking
All queries are written in SQL Server (T-SQL) and can be adapted easily to other SQL engines.

🛠️ Tech Stack
SQL Server (T-SQL)
Compatible with MySQL / PostgreSQL (minor syntax changes)

🚀 How to Run the Project
Create the database using the provided script
Execute table creation (DDL)
Insert sample data
Run analytical queries
Modify or extend queries for practice

📌 Who This Project Is For
Data Analyst / Business Analyst candidates
SQL interview preparation
Portfolio & LinkedIn showcasing
Anyone serious about learning real SQL, not textbook syntax
